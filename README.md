# support-tickets-analysis
Data Analysis project using Python (Pandas) to investigate Support Ticket logs, identify Root Causes (RCA), and optimize SLA response times.

# 🎫 Support Tickets Analysis (RCA & SLA Optimization)

## 📋 Project Overview
This project simulates and analyzes a dataset of **500 technical support tickets** to identify bottlenecks in the operation. The goal is to demonstrate how **Data Analytics** can be used to reduce MTTR (Mean Time to Resolution) and improve customer satisfaction in L2 Support environments.

## 🎯 Business Objectives
* **Identify Root Causes:** Determine which error categories generate the most volume.
* **SLA Monitoring:** Analyze resolution time based on priority levels.
* **Efficiency:** Provide insights to automate recurrent issues (Login/VPN).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python** (Data Simulation & Processing)
* **Pandas** (Data Manipulation & Aggregation)
* **Seaborn / Matplotlib** (Data Visualization)
* **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive Reporting)

## 📊 Key Insights (Simulation)
* **VPN Issues** and **Login Errors** account for the majority of tickets, suggesting a need for self-service password reset tools.
* High Priority tickets have a variance in resolution time, indicating potential process gaps in the escalation matrix.
